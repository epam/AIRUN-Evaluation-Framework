    {
      "criteria": "Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "All imported modules and code segments are utilized in the implementation without any obvious unused code."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects).",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "The implementation properly uses TypeScript interfaces, hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef), and structures the component according to React best practices."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 90,
      "explanation": "The useEffect hooks implement proper cleanup (e.g., removing event listeners) and the state management appears to minimize unnecessary re-renders. However, without runtime profiling, absolute certainty is limited."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "The implementation uses React.FC and TypeScript syntax which is compatible with React 18.x and current TypeScript standards."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 90,
      "explanation": "Based on the code inspection, there are no obvious issues that would trigger console errors or warnings. However, runtime testing would be needed to confirm completely."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "The component uses controlled inputs with state management rather than directly accessing DOM elements to retrieve values."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "There is no direct DOM manipulation apart from invoking scrollIntoView on a referenced element, which is acceptable for ensuring visibility within React's controlled component structure."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "The use of refs is limited to necessary tasks such as handling click outside events and managing focus view, which is appropriate."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 90,
      "explanation": "The state updates and re-render logic appear to be well-managed. There is no apparent indication of excessive re-rendering from the code structure."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Ensure the code adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., ARIA roles).",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": false,
      "confidence": 80,
      "explanation": "While the component manages keyboard navigation, it lacks explicit ARIA attributes (such as aria-expanded, role='combobox', or role='listbox') which are recommended for improved accessibility."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Ensure the component is written in TypeScript.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "The component is implemented using TypeScript with appropriate interface definitions and type annotations."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Verify the component is created using React 18.x.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "The answer specifies usage with React 18.x and uses compatible React patterns, confirming this criterion."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Verify the presence of an index.css file.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "An index.css file is provided with styling for the component."
    },
    {
      "criteria": "Check that the generated code does not contain any TODOs.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "There are no TODO comments or placeholder comments present in the code."
    },

      "criteria": "App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops.",
      "weight": 1.0,
      "passed": true,
      "confidence": 100,
      "explanation": "The useEffect hooks are implemented with proper dependency arrays and cleanup logic, preventing infinite loops."
